# Filter-Spam-Email
# ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection Using Structured Metadata

This project uses machine learning to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** based solely on structured metadata â€” without analyzing the full content of the emails. It offers a lightweight, privacy-respecting alternative to traditional NLP-based spam filters.

## ðŸ§  Dataset

The dataset should be a CSV file with the following columns:

| Feature            | Description                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `num_links`        | Number of hyperlinks in the email        |
| `num_attachments`  | Number of attached files                 |
